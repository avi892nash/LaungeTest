# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Testing the search and filter functionalities in `ExploreScreen.tsx` using the newly diversified data in `src/data/mockData.ts`.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx` layout to achieve a blue top section and a light grey main background, with a white card for "Membership benefits":
    - Introduced `topBlueBackgroundContainer`: Wraps header, search/filter elements. Styled with a dark blue background (`#0A2540`), horizontal padding, and bottom padding.
    - Changed `searchFilterContainer` (airport search) and `dropdownContainer` (category dropdown) backgrounds to match the blue (`#0A2540`) of `topBlueBackgroundContainer`, removing their shadows.
    - Updated text colors within these search/filter bars (`searchBarText`, `filterButtonText`, `dropdownText`) to white (`#FFFFFF`) for contrast against the new blue background.
    - `SafeAreaView` (`styles.safeArea`): Background set to light grey (`#F8F9FA`).
    - Main `container` View: Horizontal padding removed.
    - `headerContainer`: Horizontal padding removed, `marginHorizontal` added for alignment within the blue top section.
    - Replaced the text-based filter icon ('ðŸ“Š') with an `Image` component using `src/assets/images/filter.png` and updated its style (`actualFilterButtonIcon`) for width/height.
    - `benefitsContainer` (white card for lounges): `marginTop` adjusted to `0` (spacing handled by `topBlueBackgroundContainer`), `marginHorizontal` removed to make the card full-width. `backgroundColor` is white, with padding, `borderRadius: 12`, and `overflow: 'hidden'` to ensure corners are visible.
    - `membershipBenefitsTitle`: Text color remains dark (`#1C1C1E`), positioned within `benefitsContainer`.
- The overall visual structure now separates the top blue "Explore" area (with integrated blue search/filter bars and new image-based filter icon) from the main content area which has a light grey backdrop for the full-width white "Membership benefits" card.
- Corrected image loading in `src/data/mockData.ts` (using `ImageSourcePropType` and `require()`).
- Fixed `src/components/LoungeCard.tsx` to use `item.image` for image source.
- Updated `LoungeCard.tsx` styles for image-on-left layout and sharp-cornered borders (`borderRadius: 0`, `borderWidth: 1`, `borderColor: '#E0E0E0'`), with shadows removed.
- Further diversified `src/data/mockData.ts` by adding 10 more lounge entries (total 16 entries) for various airports (CDG, NRT, LAX, HKG, MUC, SYD, IST, and more for DBX, JFK, LHR, SIN) to enhance testing of search and filter features.
- Implemented lounge list filtering in `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx`:
    - Added `filteredLoungeData` state to hold the displayed lounges.
    - Introduced a `useEffect` hook to filter `mockLounges` based on `selectedAirport` (airport dropdown), `searchText` (airport text input, also filters lounge name/airport if no airport is selected), and `selectedFilter` (category dropdown).
    - Updated the lounge `FlatList` to use `filteredLoungeData`.
    - Corrected an ESLint warning by removing `mockLounges` from the `useEffect` dependency array as it's a static import.
- Configured `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` to use consistent iOS-like horizontal ("sideways") screen transition animations for all screens by setting `cardStyleInterpolator: CardStyleInterpolators.forHorizontalIOS` in the `Stack.Navigator`'s `screenOptions`.
- Fixed image display in `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx` to use local image data (`lounge.images[0]`) instead of a placeholder URL.
- Resolved ESLint warning for unused `Lounge` import in `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx`.
- Modified the filter dropdown in `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx`:
    - Removed emojis from `FILTER_OPTIONS` array and their display in `renderFilterOption` and the main `allFilterButton`.
    - Added `src/assets/images/control_tower.png` icon to the left and `src/assets/images/down.png` icon to the right of the filter text in `allFilterButton`.
    - Decreased `borderRadius` of `allFilterButton` to `8` and adjusted its padding.
    - Added new styles `controlTowerIcon` and `downArrowIcon`.
- Reworked airport search UI and UX in `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx`:
    - Removed emojis from `AIRPORT_OPTIONS` and their display in the airport suggestion list (`renderAirportOption`).
    - Restructured the airport search input field:
        - Introduced `searchInputMainContainer` as a persistent styled wrapper.
        - Added `src/assets/images/flight.png` icon to the left within this container.
        - If an airport is selected, its name and code are displayed within `searchInputMainContainer`, replacing the `TextInput`, along with a clear button.
        - If no airport is selected, the `TextInput` is displayed within `searchInputMainContainer`.
        - This change aims to resolve focus loss issues by preventing the unmounting of the core input structure.
    - Implemented keyboard dismissal (`Keyboard.dismiss()`) when the airport suggestion modal is closed by tapping the overlay or via `onRequestClose`.
    - Added explicit focus management for the airport `TextInput` using a `ref` and `setTimeout` in `handleTextInputFocus` (to re-focus after modal appears) and `handleClearSelection` (to focus when input reappears), in a further attempt to address focus being lost when the input is clicked.
- Previous: Resolved all critical build and runtime errors for iOS and Android.

## Next Steps
- Verify the updated airport search UI in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (flight icon, no emojis in list, selected airport display).
- Test airport search UX: focus retention on click/type, and keyboard dismissal when closing the suggestion modal.
- Verify the updated filter dropdown in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (removed emojis, added `control_tower.png` and `down.png` icons, reduced border radius).
- Replaced emoji icons (question mark, location pin, clock) in `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx` with `Image` components using assets from `src/assets/images/`. Added corresponding styles for these images.
- Verify that the main image in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` now displays correctly using local data.
- Verify the screen transition animation is now consistently horizontal (sideways) on both Android and iOS.
- Thoroughly test the search (text input for airports/lounge names) and filter (airport dropdown, category dropdown) functionalities in `ExploreScreen.tsx` with the expanded `mockData.ts` to ensure correct behavior.
- Verify that the new layout in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (light grey screen background, white container for benefits with rounded corners, dark title) and the existing `LoungeCard.tsx` styles (border for separation) correctly display the "Membership benefits" section as per the target design.
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the addition of more mock data and the implementation of the lounge filtering logic in `ExploreScreen.tsx`, and the icon updates in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`.
- Update `systemPatterns.md` to document the new `benefitsContainer` pattern in `ExploreScreen.tsx` if it's deemed a reusable pattern.
- Visually verify all UI changes in the application, including the new icons in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`.
- Continue replacing placeholder icons with actual icon components/assets and refine styling in other parts of the application.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Memory Bank files are crucial for maintaining context.
- Some placeholder icons have been replaced in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`. Other placeholder icons are still used temporarily in other screens; proper icons are needed for the final design.
- The orange color for icons in text fields (`#FFA500`) also affects the text; this needs refinement to apply orange only to icons and keep text dark as per the target design.
