# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Testing image serving from the `partner-backend` and the new client-side image caching mechanism.
- Ensuring `partner-backend` is operational (locally or deployed on Render) to serve images.

## Recent Changes
- **Image Handling Overhaul:**
    - Moved all static image assets from `src/assets/images/` to `partner-backend/public/images/`.
    - Updated `partner-backend/server.ts` to serve static files from the `partner-backend/public/` directory, making images accessible via `/images/filename.png`.
    - Deleted original image files from `src/assets/images/` (only `.gitkeep` remains).
    - Installed `react-native-fs` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for custom caching.
    - Created `src/services/ImageCache.ts` with logic for downloading, storing, and retrieving cached images.
    - Created a new component `src/components/CachedImage.tsx` that utilizes `ImageCache.ts` to display images, providing loading and fallback states.
    - Updated `src/data/mockData.ts`:
        - Changed image-related fields in `Lounge` and `Amenity` interfaces from `ImageSourcePropType` to `string` (for URLs).
        - Removed the `resolveImagePath` function.
        - Modified `fetchLoungesFromAPI` to construct full image URLs (e.g., `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com/images/filename.png`) from image paths received from the API.
    - Updated `src/components/LoungeCard.tsx` and `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx` to use the new `CachedImage` component and pass string URIs for all images (dynamic and static).
    - Resolved ESLint warning for unused `Image` import in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`.

- **Previous Backend Deployment Efforts (Still Relevant):**
    - Updated `src/data/mockData.ts` to change `API_BASE_URL` to `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com/api`.
    - Updated `partner-backend/package.json` to downgrade Express from `^5.1.0` to `^4.19.2` and `@types/express` from `^5.0.2` to `^4.17.21`.
    - Updated `render.yaml` to specify `NODE_VERSION: 20`.
    - Previously: Updated `render.yaml` buildCommand for `partner-backend`.
    - Previously: Updated `partner-backend/tsconfig.json` with `"types": ["node"]`.

- **Previous Frontend UI/UX Changes (Context):**
    - Refactored `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx` layout (blue top section, grey background, white card).
    - Corrected various image loading issues and updated `LoungeCard.tsx` styles.
    - Expanded `mockData.ts` (now superseded by API fetching for image paths).
    - Implemented lounge list filtering in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
    - Configured consistent screen transition animations.
    - Updated icons and image displays in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` and `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
    - Resolved "Image path not found" errors by correcting paths in `partner-backend/initial-lounge-data.json`.

## Next Steps
- **Crucial:** User to ensure the `partner-backend` is running correctly (locally or deployed at `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com`) so that images can be served via the new URLs. The previous Render deployment issues need to be confirmed as resolved.
- User to run `npx pod-install` (or `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`) to link the new native dependencies (`react-native-fs`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`) for iOS.
- Thoroughly test image loading and caching functionality across the app (e.g., in `LoungeCard` and `OfferDetailScreen`). Verify images load from the backend and are subsequently served from the local cache.
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the image handling changes and new dependencies.
- Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to document the custom image caching mechanism.
- Update `memory-bank/techContext.md` with the new dependencies.
- Update `.clinerules` with insights from the image caching implementation (e.g., React 19 compatibility issues, custom solution details).
- If `partner-backend` deployment on Render is still failing, analyze new error messages and address them. This is critical for the remote image URLs to work.
- (Previous Frontend Next Steps - to be revisited after backend deployment and image caching are verified):
    - Verify UI/UX of `ExploreScreen.tsx` (airport search, filter dropdown).
    - Test search and filter functionalities.
    - Continue replacing placeholder icons and refining styling.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Custom Image Caching:** A custom image caching solution was implemented using `react-native-fs` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`. This was chosen due to `react-native-fast-image` having peer dependency conflicts with the project's React 19 version.
- Memory Bank files are crucial for maintaining context.
- Some placeholder icons (text-based like ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üé´) are still used in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`; these might need to be replaced with image assets if a consistent visual style is desired.
- The orange color for icons in text fields (`#FFA500`) in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (mentioned in previous context) still needs refinement if applicable.
