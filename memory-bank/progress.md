# Progress

## What Works
- **Image Handling and Caching System Implemented:**
    - Images moved from `src/assets/images/` to `partner-backend/public/images/`.
    - `partner-backend/server.ts` updated to serve static files from `partner-backend/public/`, enabling image serving via URLs like `/images/filename.png`.
    - Original local images deleted from `src/assets/images/`.
    - Dependencies `react-native-fs` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` installed for custom caching.
    - Custom image caching service created at `src/services/ImageCache.ts`.
    - `CachedImage` component (`src/components/CachedImage.tsx`) created to display and cache images from URLs.
    - `src/data/mockData.ts` updated:
        - Interfaces (`Lounge`, `Amenity`) now use `string` type for image/icon URLs.
        - `fetchLoungesFromAPI` now constructs full image URLs (e.g., `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com/images/filename.png`) from backend data.
        - `resolveImagePath` function removed.
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` and `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` updated to use `CachedImage` component for all dynamic and static images, sourcing them via URLs.
    - This new system replaces previous local image loading (e.g., `resolveImagePath`, direct `require()` calls for content images).

- **Partner Offer Dashboard Converted to React Application:**
    - **Project Setup:** Vite + React + TypeScript project initialized in `partner-backend/partner-frontend`. Dependencies installed. Old static files backed up.
    - **Core Components (`partner-backend/partner-frontend/src/`):**
        - `App.tsx`: Manages overall layout and view switching.
        - `components/Sidebar.tsx`: Handles navigation.
        - `components/IntegrateOfferForm.tsx`: Replicates form functionality with React state, including predefined amenities and file uploads.
        - `components/ViewPartners.tsx`: Fetches and displays partner/offer data.
    - **Styling:** Existing CSS (`style.css` from backup) moved to `src/index.css` and imported globally.
    - **Vite Config (`vite.config.ts`):** API proxy to `http://localhost:3001` configured for development.
    - **Backend Server (`partner-backend/server.ts`):** Updated to serve the React app's `dist` folder for production and handle fallback routing.

- **Backend API Base URL Configured (Previous):**
    - `src/data/mockData.ts` uses `API_BASE_URL = 'https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com/api'`.

- **Attempted fix for `partner-backend` deployment errors (Verification Pending):**
    - `partner-backend/package.json` (Express downgraded), `render.yaml` (Node version updated), `partner-backend/tsconfig.json` (types:node added).

- **Basic Application Structure:**
    - Running on Android and iOS.
    - Critical frontend build/runtime errors previously resolved.

- **Frontend UI/UX Enhancements (Implemented, some pending full verification with new image system):**
    - `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout refactored (blue top section, grey background, white card).
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` styles updated (image-on-left, borders).
    - Dynamic lounge list filtering in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
    - Consistent horizontal screen transitions in `AppNavigator.tsx`.
    - UI updates to filter dropdown and airport search in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (icons, no emojis).
    - Previous "Image path not found" errors (related to `initial-lounge-data.json` prefixes) resolved.

## What's Left to Build
- **Testing and Verification:**
    - **Crucial:** Test the **new React-based Partner Offer Dashboard**.
        - Build the React app: `cd partner-backend/partner-frontend && npm run build`.
        - Run the backend server: `cd partner-backend && npm start` (or similar).
        - Access `http://localhost:3001` in a browser.
        - Verify:
            - Sidebar navigation works.
            - "Integrate New Offer" form:
                - All fields are present and functional.
                - Predefined amenities selection works.
                - Form submission (including file uploads) to `/api/integrate-offer` is successful.
                - Response messages are displayed.
            - "View Partners & Offers" section:
                - "Load Partners & Offers" button fetches and displays data correctly.
                - Clicking a partner shows their specific offers.
    - **Crucial:** Test image loading from the backend and the new caching mechanism thoroughly across all relevant screens and components in the React Native app.
    - Verify `partner-backend` is operational (locally or on Render at `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com`) to serve images and API data for both the React Native app and the partner dashboard.
    - User to run `npx pod-install` (or `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`) to link new native dependencies for iOS.
    - Visually verify all images (dynamic content, static icons now loaded via URL) in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`, `LoungeCard.tsx`, etc.
    - Verify consistent horizontal screen transition animation on both Android and iOS.
    - Thoroughly test search and filter functionalities in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
    - Visually verify all updated `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout elements.
    - Test airport search UX in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (focus retention, keyboard dismissal).
- **Styling and UI Refinements:**
    - Address any persistent styling issues (e.g., if Metro Bundler caching was a problem).
    - Integrate actual icon components/assets for any remaining text-based placeholders (e.g., ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üé´ in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`).
    - Refine styling for icons in input fields in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (orange icons, dark text).
- **Functionality:**
    - Implement functionality for the new filter button in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
- **Documentation & Project Setup:**
    - Populate other sections of the Memory Bank (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) with detailed project information.
    - Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md` (partially done by Cline, review needed).
    - Update `.clinerules` (partially done by Cline, review needed).
- **Future Features:**
    - Build out other screens and features of the LoungeApp.

## Current Status
- **Partner Offer Dashboard:** Successfully converted to a React application using Vite. Includes sidebar navigation, offer integration form (with predefined amenities and file uploads), and partner/offer viewing capabilities. Backend server updated to serve the built React app. Ready for build and comprehensive testing.
- **Image Handling (React Native App):** New system for serving images from backend and caching on client-side is implemented. Ready for testing, contingent on backend availability and iOS pod installation.
- **Backend Deployment:** Still a critical point. Verification of fixes for Render deployment is pending. Functionality of the new image system and the partner dashboard's data loading depends on this.
- **Frontend (React Native App):**
    - `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout and UI elements (filter, search) refactored.
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` and `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` adapted for new image system.
    - Application is stable from previous critical error resolutions.
    - Data fetching from API is in place; image URL construction is now part of this.
- Metro bundler is assumed to be running for development.

## Known Issues
- **`partner-backend` deployment on Render failing (Critical):** Previous attempts to fix are pending verification. This directly impacts the ability to test the new image loading from `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com`.
- User reports that previous styling changes (rounded corners on benefits container, blue search bars) might not be appearing. This could be a Metro Bundler caching issue.
- The `‚úï` icon for clearing a selected airport is an intended UI feature. Other general placeholder icons might exist elsewhere (e.g., text emojis ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üé´).
- The current styling for icons within text inputs (`searchBarText`, `dropdownText`) in `ExploreScreen.tsx` uses a single color (`#FFFFFF`) for both the icon character and the text. This needs to be adjusted so icons are orange and text is dark, as per the target design.
- The new filter button in `ExploreScreen.tsx` is present structurally but has no functionality.
