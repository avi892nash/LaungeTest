# Progress

## What Works
- **Image Handling and Caching System Implemented:**
    - Images moved from `src/assets/images/` to `partner-backend/public/images/`.
    - `partner-backend/server.ts` updated to serve static files from `partner-backend/public/`, enabling image serving via URLs like `/images/filename.png`.
    - Original local images deleted from `src/assets/images/`.
    - Dependencies `react-native-fs` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` installed for custom caching.
    - Custom image caching service created at `src/services/ImageCache.ts`.
    - `CachedImage` component (`src/components/CachedImage.tsx`) created to display and cache images from URLs.
    - `src/data/mockData.ts` updated:
        - Interfaces (`Lounge`, `Amenity`) now use `string` type for image/icon URLs.
        - `fetchLoungesFromAPI` now constructs full image URLs (e.g., `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com/images/filename.png`) from backend data.
        - `resolveImagePath` function removed.
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` and `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` updated to use `CachedImage` component for all dynamic and static images, sourcing them via URLs.
    - This new system replaces previous local image loading (e.g., `resolveImagePath`, direct `require()` calls for content images).

- **Backend Data Restructuring for Partner Offer Dashboard:**
    - Created `partner-backend/structured-data.json`, a new file that stores partner information with their associated offers in a nested JSON structure. This replaces the previous flat list in `partner-backend/initial-lounge-data.json`.
    - Modified `partner-backend/server.ts` to:
        - Load initial data from `structured-data.json`.
        - Use new internal data types (`PartnerWithOffers`, `OfferInPartner`, `FlatOffer`) to manage this nested data.
        - Update the `/api/partners` and `/api/offers` GET endpoints to serve data derived from the new structured store, maintaining compatibility with frontend expectations.
        - Update the `/api/integrate-partner` and `/api/partners/:partnerId/offers` POST endpoints to correctly modify the in-memory `structuredDataStore`.

- **Partner Offer Dashboard Converted to React Application:**
    - **Project Setup:** Vite + React + TypeScript project initialized in `partner-backend/partner-frontend`. Dependencies installed. Old static files backed up.
    - **Core Components (`partner-backend/partner-frontend/src/`):**
        - `App.tsx`: Manages overall layout and view switching.
        - `components/Sidebar.tsx`: Handles navigation.
        - `components/IntegrateOfferForm.tsx`: Replicates form functionality with React state, including predefined amenities and file uploads.
        - `components/ViewPartners.tsx`: 
            - Fetches and displays partner/offer data. Data is now fetched automatically when the component loads; manual "Load Partners & Offers" button removed.
            - Main partner list UI modernized with improved button styles and list appearance. Partner names displayed instead of IDs where available. Bank logos (partner logos) are now displayed next to each partner in this list, with corrected URL construction to include the `/images/` path.
            - When a partner is selected, displays a two-column layout:
                - Left column: Lists offers for that partner.
                - Right column: Shows details of a selected offer using the new `OfferCardView.tsx` component.
            - Includes a "Back to All Partners" button.
        - `components/OfferCardView.tsx`: New component created to display individual offer details in a card format, including image, bank logo, and key information, with an expandable section for full details. Image paths within this component are now correctly prefixed with `/images/`.
    - **Styling:** Existing CSS (`style.css` from backup) moved to `src/index.css` and imported globally. New classes added for modern UI elements in `ViewPartners.tsx` (including `.partner-list-logo`) and for the `OfferCardView.tsx` component and its layout.
    - **Vite Config (`vite.config.ts`):** API proxy to `http://localhost:3001` configured for development.
    - **Backend Server (`partner-backend/server.ts`):** Updated to serve the React app's `dist` folder for production and handle fallback routing.
    - **UI Improvement (View Full Data):** The "View Full Data" section within `ViewPartners.tsx` now displays offer details in a structured HTML table instead of a raw JSON string. Corresponding CSS for `.offer-details-table` added to `index.css`. Changes committed and pushed.
- **Partner Offer Dashboard - `AddOfferForm.tsx` Bug Fix:**
    - Corrected an issue in `partner-backend/partner-frontend/src/components/AddOfferForm.tsx` where manually entered form data (e.g., Offer Title, Bank Name) was cleared when changing the selected lounge location or offer configuration. The `useEffect` hook responsible was updated to preserve existing form data.
- **Partner Offer Dashboard - Automatic Random Amenities in `AddOfferForm.tsx`:**
    - Removed manual amenity selection UI from the form (`partner-backend/partner-frontend/src/components/AddOfferForm.tsx`).
    - Implemented functionality to automatically assign 5 random amenities to each new offer upon submission.
- **Backend - Corrected Partner Logo Path Storage (`server.ts`):**
    - Modified the `/api/integrate-partner` endpoint in `partner-backend/server.ts` to store only the filename (e.g., `bankLogo-timestamp.jpg`) for partner logos, instead of `images/filename.jpg`. This prevents URL malformation (e.g., `images/images/filename.jpg`) when the frontend constructs the full image path.

- **Backend API Base URL Configured (Previous):**
    - `src/data/mockData.ts` uses `API_BASE_URL = 'https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com/api'`.

- **Attempted fix for `partner-backend` deployment errors (Verification Pending):**
    - `partner-backend/package.json` (Express downgraded), `render.yaml` (Node version updated), `partner-backend/tsconfig.json` (types:node added).

- **Basic Application Structure:**
    - Running on Android and iOS.
    - Critical frontend build/runtime errors previously resolved.

- **Frontend UI/UX Enhancements (Implemented, some pending full verification with new image system):**
    - `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout refactored (blue top section, grey background, white card).
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` styles updated (image-on-left, borders).
    - Dynamic lounge list filtering in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
    - Consistent horizontal screen transitions in `AppNavigator.tsx`.
    - UI updates to filter dropdown and airport search in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (icons, no emojis).
    - Previous "Image path not found" errors (related to `initial-lounge-data.json` prefixes) resolved.

## What's Left to Build
- **Testing and Verification:**
    - **Crucial:** Test the **new React-based Partner Offer Dashboard**.
        - Build the React app: `cd partner-backend/partner-frontend && npm run build`.
        - Run the backend server: `cd partner-backend && npm start` (or similar).
        - Access `http://localhost:3001` in a browser.
        - Verify:
            - Sidebar navigation works.
            - "Integrate New Offer" form (now primarily "Integrate New Partner" form, and a separate "Add Offer to Partner" flow):
                - All fields are present and functional.
                - Predefined amenities selection works (for adding offers).
                - Form submission for new partners (`/api/integrate-partner`) and new offers (`/api/partners/:partnerId/offers`) is successful.
                - Response messages are displayed.
            - "View Partners & Offers" section:
                - Data (partners and their offers) should load automatically from the new backend structure when the tab is opened.
                - Main partner list should display correctly.
                - Clicking a partner should correctly show their associated offers.
                - All image paths (partner logos, offer images) should be correct.
    - **Crucial:** Test image loading from the backend (especially in `OfferCardView.tsx`) and the new caching mechanism thoroughly across all relevant screens and components in the React Native app.
    - Verify `partner-backend` is operational (locally or on Render at `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com`) to serve images and API data for both the React Native app and the partner dashboard.
    - User to run `npx pod-install` (or `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`) to link new native dependencies for iOS.
    - Visually verify all images (dynamic content, static icons now loaded via URL) in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`, `LoungeCard.tsx`, etc. Ensure that images for offers added via the partner dashboard load correctly without duplicated path segments.
    - Verify consistent horizontal screen transition animation on both Android and iOS.
    - Thoroughly test search and filter functionalities in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
    - Visually verify all updated `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout elements.
    - Test airport search UX in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (focus retention, keyboard dismissal).
- **Styling and UI Refinements:**
    - Address any persistent styling issues (e.g., if Metro Bundler caching was a problem).
    - Integrate actual icon components/assets for any remaining text-based placeholders (e.g., ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üé´ in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx`).
    - Refine styling for icons in input fields in `ExploreScreen.tsx` (orange icons, dark text).
- **Functionality:**
    - Implement functionality for the new filter button in `ExploreScreen.tsx`.
- **Documentation & Project Setup:**
    - Populate other sections of the Memory Bank (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) with detailed project information.
    - Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md` (partially done by Cline, review needed).
    - Update `.clinerules` (partially done by Cline, review needed).
- **Future Features:**
    - Build out other screens and features of the LoungeApp.

## Current Status
- **Partner Offer Dashboard:** Successfully converted to a React application using Vite. Includes sidebar navigation, offer integration form (with predefined amenities and file uploads), and partner/offer viewing capabilities.
    - In the "View Partners & Offers" section (`ViewPartners.tsx`):
        - Data is now fetched automatically on component load; the manual load button has been removed.
        - The main partner list UI has been modernized, now including bank logos (partner logos) next to partner names, with corrected URL paths.
        - A new two-column layout is implemented for displaying a partner's offers (left column) and the details of a selected offer in a new `OfferCardView.tsx` component (right column).
        - A "Back to All Partners" button allows navigation from the detailed view.
    - The `OfferCardView.tsx` component provides a structured and more visual display of offer details, with corrected image path prefixing.
    - The "View Full Data" (within `OfferCardView` and previously in `ViewPartners`) uses a tabular display.
    - Fixed a bug in `AddOfferForm.tsx` to prevent unintended clearing of form fields during preset/location changes.
    - Amenity selection in `AddOfferForm.tsx` is now automated: manual selection UI removed, 5 random amenities are assigned on offer creation.
    - Backend server updated to serve the built React app.
    - All recent changes committed and pushed. Ready for build and comprehensive testing.
- **Backend Data Handling:**
    - Initial data is now loaded from `partner-backend/structured-data.json` which has a nested partner-offer structure.
    - `partner-backend/server.ts` has been updated to process this new structure for its API endpoints (`/api/partners`, `/api/offers`, and POST endpoints for adding partners/offers).
    - The `/api/integrate-partner` endpoint now correctly stores partner logo paths as filenames only, ensuring proper URL construction by the frontend.
    - Data modifications via API are currently in-memory and do not persist back to the `structured-data.json` file on disk.
- **Image Handling (React Native App):** New system for serving images from backend and caching on client-side is implemented. Ready for testing, contingent on backend availability and iOS pod installation.
- **Backend Deployment:** Still a critical point. Verification of fixes for Render deployment is pending. Functionality of the new image system and the partner dashboard's data loading depends on this.
- **Backend Image Path Handling:** Corrected an issue in `partner-backend/server.ts` where `/images/` was being prepended to image filenames during offer creation via the partner dashboard. It now stores plain filenames. (This refers to an older fix, the new structure also ensures correct pathing).
- **Frontend (React Native App):**
    - `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout and UI elements (filter, search) refactored.
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` and `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` adapted for new image system.
    - Application is stable from previous critical error resolutions.
    - Data fetching from API is in place; image URL construction is now part of this.
- Metro bundler is assumed to be running for development.

## Known Issues
- **`partner-backend` deployment on Render failing (Critical):** Previous attempts to fix are pending verification. This directly impacts the ability to test the new image loading from `https://lounge-app-536s.onrender.com`.
- User reports that previous styling changes (rounded corners on benefits container, blue search bars) might not be appearing. This could be a Metro Bundler caching issue.
- The `‚úï` icon for clearing a selected airport is an intended UI feature. Other general placeholder icons might exist elsewhere (e.g., text emojis ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üé´).
- The current styling for icons within text inputs (`searchBarText`, `dropdownText`) in `ExploreScreen.tsx` uses a single color (`#FFFFFF`) for both the icon character and the text. This needs to be adjusted so icons are orange and text is dark, as per the target design.
- The new filter button in `ExploreScreen.tsx` is present structurally but has no functionality.
- **Image URL Duplication (Resolved):** An issue where image URLs could be malformed (e.g., `.../images/images/filename.png`) for offers added via the partner dashboard has been fixed by correcting how the backend stores image paths.
