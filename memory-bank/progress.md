# Progress

## What Works
- **Attempted fix for `partner-backend` deployment errors**:
    - Updated `partner-backend/package.json` to downgrade Express from `^5.1.0` to `^4.19.2` and `@types/express` from `^5.0.2` to `^4.17.21`.
    - Updated `render.yaml` to specify `NODE_VERSION: 20` (upgraded from 18).
    - Previously: Updated `render.yaml` to change the `buildCommand` for the `lounge-app` service (partner-backend) to `npm install && npm run build`.
    - Previously: Updated `partner-backend/tsconfig.json` by adding `"types": ["node"]` to `compilerOptions`.
    - Deployment verification is pending for these combined changes.
- Basic application structure is running on Android and iOS.
- Critical build and runtime errors have been resolved (for frontend).
- Refactored `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout to achieve a blue top "Explore" section and a light grey main background:
    - Introduced `topBlueBackgroundContainer` with a dark blue background (`#0A2540`) for the header and filter elements.
    - Changed `searchFilterContainer` (airport search) and `dropdownContainer` (category dropdown) backgrounds to match this blue, with their text/icon colors changed to white for contrast. Shadows were removed from these elements.
    - Replaced the text-based filter icon ('ðŸ“Š') in `actualFilterButton` with an `Image` component using `src/assets/images/filter.png`.
    - `SafeAreaView` background set to light grey (`#F8F9FA`).
    - `benefitsContainer` (white card for lounges) is displayed on the light grey background, below the blue top section. It is full-width (no horizontal margins), with internal padding, `borderRadius: 12`, and `overflow: 'hidden'` to ensure corners clip content.
    - `membershipBenefitsTitle` is dark and correctly positioned within `benefitsContainer`.
- Existing UI elements (header, search/filter bars, etc.) are structured within this new layout.
- Corrected image loading in `src/data/mockData.ts` (using `ImageSourcePropType` and `require()`).
- Fixed `src/components/LoungeCard.tsx` to use `item.image` for image source.
- Updated `LoungeCard.tsx` styles for image-on-left layout and sharp-cornered borders (`borderRadius: 0`, `borderWidth: 1`, `borderColor: '#E0E0E0'`), with shadows removed.
- Further diversified `src/data/mockData.ts` by adding 10 more lounge entries, bringing the total to 16. This includes a wider range of airports and lounge details to thoroughly test search and filter functionalities.
- Implemented dynamic filtering for the lounge list in `ExploreScreen.tsx`:
    - Uses a `useEffect` hook that responds to changes in selected airport (from dropdown), search text (from airport input field, also filters lounge name/airport), and selected filter category (from filter dropdown).
    - Displays filtered results in the "Membership benefits" section.
    - Resolved an ESLint warning related to `useEffect` dependencies.
- Configured `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` for consistent iOS-like horizontal screen transitions (`CardStyleInterpolators.forHorizontalIOS`).
- Image in `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx` now correctly loads from local data (`lounge.images[0]`).
- Replaced emoji icons (question mark, location pin, clock) in `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx` with `Image` components using assets from `src/assets/images/` and added corresponding styles.
- Resolved ESLint warning for unused `Lounge` import in `src/screens/OfferDetailScreen.tsx`.
- Updated the filter dropdown in `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx`:
    - Emojis removed from filter options and display.
    - `src/assets/images/control_tower.png` icon added to the left of the filter text.
    - `src/assets/images/down.png` icon added to the right of the filter text (replacing text arrow).
    - Border radius of the main filter button (`allFilterButton`) reduced to `8` and padding adjusted.
- Reworked airport search input and dropdown in `src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx`:
    - Emojis removed from airport options and suggestion list.
    - `src/assets/images/flight.png` icon added to the left of the airport search area.
    - The search area now uses a persistent styled container (`searchInputMainContainer`). When an airport is selected, it's displayed within this container (replacing the `TextInput`) along with a clear button. Otherwise, the `TextInput` is shown. This structure is intended to improve focus handling.
    - Keyboard is now dismissed when the airport suggestion modal is closed (via overlay tap or `onRequestClose`).
    - Added explicit focus management using a `ref` for the `TextInput` and `setTimeout` to call `focus()` in `handleTextInputFocus` and `handleClearSelection`, aiming to maintain focus when the input is clicked or cleared.
- Resolved "Image path not found in resolveImagePath" errors:
    - Corrected image paths in `partner-backend/initial-lounge-data.json` by removing the `../assets/images/` prefix.
    - Restarted the `partner-backend` server.
    - Images are now loading correctly in the application.

## What's Left to Build
- Visually verify new icon images in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` (main image verified as working).
- Verify consistent horizontal screen transition animation on both Android and iOS.
- Thoroughly test the implemented search (text input for airports/lounge names) and filter (airport dropdown, category dropdown) functionalities in `ExploreScreen.tsx` using the expanded (16 entries) `mockData.ts`.
- Visually verify all updated `ExploreScreen.tsx` layout elements:
    - Blue top section, light grey main background, white benefits card.
    - Updated filter dropdown (icons, no emojis, new radius).
    - Updated airport search (flight icon, no emojis in list, selected airport display).
    - Test airport search UX: focus retention on click/type, and keyboard dismissal.
    - `LoungeCard.tsx` appearance.
- Address persistent styling issues if they are not resolved by a Metro Bundler cache reset (e.g., rounded corners not appearing, search bars not blue).
- Integrate actual icon components/assets (e.g., from an icon library) to replace any remaining placeholders in `ExploreScreen.tsx`. (Note: Airport list emojis removed, `âœ•` for clear is intentional).
- Refine styling for icons in input fields to achieve the target orange color for icons while keeping the input text dark (Note: current implementation changed placeholder icon text to white, this might need further refinement if icons are separate from text).
- Implement functionality for the new filter button.
- Populate other sections of the Memory Bank (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) with detailed project information.
- Build out other screens and features of the LoungeApp.

## Current Status
- Layout of `ExploreScreen.tsx` has been refactored. The filter dropdown UI has been updated (icons, no emojis, new radius). The airport search UI has been updated (flight icon, no emojis in list, new display for selected airport, keyboard dismissal, attempted focus retention fix). Visual verification and UX testing (focus, keyboard) for airport search are pending.
- Metro bundler is running.
- Application is stable after resolving previous critical errors.
- Image loading, `LoungeCard.tsx` layout, and border styles are updated; visual verification of card design within the new screen layout is pending.
- `src/data/mockData.ts` has been significantly expanded to 16 entries with diverse data.
- Lounge list filtering logic based on airport selection (dropdown and text input) and category filter is implemented in `ExploreScreen.tsx` and ready for testing.
- Screen transition animations configured for horizontal (iOS-like) behavior; verification pending.
- Image loading in `OfferDetailScreen.tsx` fixed and verified.
- Image loading throughout the app (via `resolveImagePath`) fixed and verified.

## Known Issues
- User reports that previous styling changes (rounded corners on benefits container, blue search bars) might not be appearing. This could be a Metro Bundler caching issue. (Note: This may be resolved now that the app has likely been rebuilt/reloaded to test the image fix).
- The `âœ•` icon for clearing a selected airport is an intended UI feature. Other general placeholder icons might exist elsewhere.
- The current styling for icons within text inputs (`searchBarText`, `dropdownText`) in `ExploreScreen.tsx` uses a single color (`#FFFFFF`) for both the icon character and the text. This needs to be adjusted so icons are orange and text is dark, as per the target design.
- The new filter button is present structurally but has no functionality.
- **`partner-backend` deployment on Render failing**: Previously encountered `TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError` and issues with TypeScript not finding modules/types and Node.js globals.
    - Attempted fix 1: Added `"types": ["node"]` to `partner-backend/tsconfig.json`.
    - Attempted fix 2: Changed `buildCommand` in `render.yaml` to `npm install && npm run build`.
    - Attempted fix 3 (current): Downgraded Express to `^4.19.2` and `@types/express` to `^4.17.21` in `partner-backend/package.json`.
    - Attempted fix 4 (current): Updated `render.yaml` to use `NODE_VERSION: 20`.
    - Verification of these latest changes is pending.
