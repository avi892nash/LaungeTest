## UI Layout Patterns
- **Row with Sibling Elements**:
    - In `ExploreScreen.tsx`, a `View` with `flexDirection: 'row'` (`styles.newFilterButtonRow`) is used to position a flexible-width dropdown (`styles.dropdownContainer` with `flex: 1`) alongside a fixed-width button (`styles.actualFilterButton`). This pattern allows for an input-like element to take available space while a button or icon sits neatly beside it.
