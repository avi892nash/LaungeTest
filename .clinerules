# Cline Rules for LoungeApp

## Project Intelligence

- **Memory Management:** Due to session memory resets, maintaining the `memory-bank/` directory is critical. All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) MUST be read at the start of every session and updated as needed.
- **Error Resolution:** When encountering errors, systematically try common solutions. For React Native "Unable to load script" errors, the first step is usually to ensure the Metro bundler is running.
